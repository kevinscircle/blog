# Mini Challenge 1

## Full CRUDS functionality

### Acceptance Criteria
1. As an end user I'd like to be able to create new posts.
2. As an end user, when I create a new post, I'd like to see the detail page for it so I can confirm its contents.
3. As an end user, I'd like to see a list of posts so I can stay up to date on articles or posts.
4. As an end user, I'd like to click on a post that piques my interest so I can continue reading it.
4.1. This alludes to the detail page.
5. There should be links on the navbar, on the `list.html` template, and anywhere else to ensure all views are accesible through the web app (without interacting with the browser's address bar).
6. Test!

## Bonus
Pick a theme for your blog project (such as music, sports, TV, etc) and design your site around that theme (CSS, JS, etc).

### Note
Make sure you have all the necessary views, urlpatterns, templates as well as configurations for this.
